# Serverless completer for VSCode
A VsCode plugin that provides intellisense and linting for `serverless.yml` files. This is based on the examples provided in the serverless framework website, but does not cover every single option like `resouces` which relies of CloudFormation templates. 

## WIP
Pull requests are very welcome. 

## Install
- [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=securisec.serverless-completer)
